### Before starting my software engineer journey I was solving problems in the choatic world of logistics.
  While still in high school I began working full time at a warehouse where I would eventually be promoted to manager.  My boss/co-workers quickly noticed my work ethic and ability to make impactful decisions which made them realize although I was young, I was a great leader.

#### I am no stranger to hard work.
I really love working.  For 2 years I maintained two jobs recieving promotions at both.  My second job promoted me within 4 months of my start date.  When the restaurant was shut down after COVID-19, I swiftly found another second job to keep the grind going! 
  
### After 6 years of working with the same company I decided it was time for a change.
  Being located near the Silicon Valley, I have always pondered the idea of getting into tech.  My brother showed me App Academy which immediately sparked my interest.  I decided to attend their most challenging program and make the transition into a career in SWE.  Between my past work experience and my academic career at App Academy, I beleive I will be an extremely valuable asset to any company that hires me. 

## During App Academy
  I built many projects but these are the 3 I am most proud of... <a target="_blank" href="https://nickgentrybjj.github.io/Pick_Your_Poison/">🥋 vanilla JavaScript UFC Statistic Data Visualizer</a>, a <a target="_blank" href="https://ezconnex.onrender.com/">  Rails/React fullstack app</a>, and a <a target="_blank" href="https://myfridge-tkk4.onrender.com/login"> 🍜 team-based MERN fullstack app</a>

## After App Academy
  I was hired as a private Web Developer for <a target="_blank" href="https://nickgentrybjj.github.io/CalAutoTech/">Cal Auto Tech<a/>, a specialized rim repair technician seeking an online presence. I provided them with a user-friendly webpage detailing their services. Feel free to explore the <a target="_blank" href="https://nickgentrybjj.github.io/CalAutoTech/">Live Web Page<a/> or <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/NickGentryBJJ/CalAutoTech">Git Repository!<a/>
Currently, I'm seeking opportunities to build websites for more local small businesses. If you or someone you know could benefit from a professional online presence, don't hesitate to reach out!
